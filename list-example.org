** Lord of the Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
   - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
