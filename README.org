* Org Mode Guide

** Intro
   This is only an introductory guide. Some of the content in this guide came from the Org[fn:1] website.

** Headlines
   By default, headlines have to start on the left margin and are collapsable with tab

** Lists
   - Unordered list items start with '-', '+', or '*' as bullets
   - Ordered list items start with '1.' or '1)'
   - Description list use '::' (with a space before and after) to seperate the term from the description
*** Lord of the Rings
    My favorite scenes are (in this order)
    1. The attack of the Rohirrim
    2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
       + this was already my favorite scene in the book
       + I really like Miranda Otto.
    Important actors in this film are:
    - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
    - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.
